# MCP Java Servers

Welcome to the **MCP Java Servers** repository!  
This monorepo hosts multiple **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** compliant servers, all built using **Spring Boot** and **Java**.  
Each server is designed to act as a **starter pack**, offering practical examples for building MCP-connected applications.

---

## 📚 What this repository is about

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an emerging standard for connecting apps with powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) through structured messaging.
- This repo demonstrates how to build **production-ready MCP servers** in Java, following modern Spring Boot best practices.
- Each server in this monorepo handles a specific task — such as interacting with databases, emails, or external APIs — in a clean, scalable, and extensible way.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure


```plaintext
mcp-java-servers/
│
├── database-nql-server/ # MCP server for interacting with databases (e.g., MySQL)
│ └── README.md # Detailed instructions for the database server
│
├── email-server/ # MCP server for handling email-related actions
  └── README.md # Detailed instructions for the email server

```

✅ **Each server** will be a **standalone Spring Boot application**, designed following microservices principles.

✅ **Each server** has its **own README.md** file with detailed setup instructions, usage examples, and API endpoints.

---

## 📌 Goals

- Provide **real-world working examples** of MCP server implementations.
- Help developers **quickly set up** new MCP-compliant services.
- Serve as a **launchpad** for more advanced, production-grade MCP servers in Java.
- Showcase **clean architecture, modular design, and scalability**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Java 21+**
- **Spring Boot 3+**
- **LangChain4j** for LLM interactions
- **MCP Model Definitions**
- **JDBC / JPA** for database connectivity
- **Docker** (optional) for containerization (future)
- **CI/CD pipelines** (future)

## 📖 How to Get Started

Each server has its own instructions!  
Please navigate to the respective server folder and check the individual **`README.md`**.

Example:

```bash
cd database-nql-server
cat README.md
```
